# Car recognize system

This model recognizes vehicle of some classes.

At first yolov5 detect car in the picture and crop it out. Then EficientNet classifier decides which vehicle is in the picture

EficientNet classes: `ambulance`, `common`, `fire-truck`, `police`, `tractor`


```
usage: main.py [-h] --source SOURCE [-e] [-n N]

Recognize car

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --source SOURCE  Source image file or dir with files
  -e               Extended prediction view
  -n N             Max number of source images from dir to recognize
```

## Demo recognization

```
python main.py --source data -n 16
